Swift 3 Video Player

The best way for you to learn AVKit and AVFoundation is to dive in and build your first playback app. This chapter shows you how to get started with these frameworks by walking you through the development of a basic app for iOS, tvOS, and macOS to play media served using HTTP Live Streaming. This project requires that you be familiar with developing apps for at least one of these platforms. For more information, see Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift) and Mac App Programming Guide. The example projects in this chapter are written in Swift 3 and require Xcode 8.0 or later.
